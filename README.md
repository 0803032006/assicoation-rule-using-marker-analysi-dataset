# 🛒 Association Rule Mining using Market Basket Analysis

This project demonstrates **Association Rule Mining** on market basket data using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.
Association rule mining is an unsupervised data mining technique used to discover relationships between items frequently purchased together.

The project helps understand customer purchasing behavior using the **Apriori Algorithm** and association metrics such as **support**, **confidence**, and **lift**.
